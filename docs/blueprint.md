# **App Name**: Error Decoder

- Error Analysis: Analyze the error message using a generative AI tool, provide possible causes, and suggest solutions. The LLM may incorporate web search into its output if necessary to understand the error. The LLM acts as a tool that decides when to incorporate web searches into its reasoning.
- Error Display: Display the original error message.
- Analysis Display: Display the analysis, possible causes, and suggested solutions generated by the AI.
- Error Input: Accept copy/pasted errors via a text box, from the user.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calming blue (#64B5F6), reminiscent of technical environments but still approachable.

- Accent color: A muted orange (#FFAB40) to highlight important suggestions and calls to action.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look.  This font will be used for both headlines and body text, for simplicity.
- Simple, geometric icons for error categories and solutions.
- A clean, single-column layout to focus on the error message and analysis.
- Subtle fade-in animations for the AI analysis to avoid overwhelming the user.
